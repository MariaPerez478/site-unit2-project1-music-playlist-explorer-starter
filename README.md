### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in the labs prepared me to complete the assignment by for example teaching me how to use different for loops and how to use if statements correctly in JavaScript. Also, how to create elements, appendChild, get element, and documentID.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time i wold have used a heart icon instead of a heart image since the image was not able to able to change the color just the heart but the whole container. To make the likes visible the heart grows bigger when liked. Also, with more time I would have added a search bar to be able to search for playlist by name or creator. I also would have spent more time in the css and make it more asthetically pleasing if I had more time.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The things that went well were the shuffle button and the displaying of the playlist cards in the playlist page. Things that did not go as planned were the like button because at first it would not adjust the number of likes even though it was receiving the ID# of the playlists. I was able to fix it by changing the === to == in my logic. After that the like button started working perfectly, I just wished it was an icon and not a picture to edit it more. Something that my peer did that I would like to try next time is changing the color scheme to make it for dark mode since I think it looks great and it's a cool idea.
